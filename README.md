# Carol Dsilva Portfolio Website

The following is a collection of my latest and most meaningful projects. Each piece is unique in style and content and represents a distinct moment in my career.

The website is made using React JS, Javascript, CSS and Html. Image recources were downloaded from Freepix.

Being a lifelong learner is a trait that is really important to me, and I know that a good education is not just for the schoolyard. Some lessons were learned in the traditional way, while others I have received from professional mentors, while working and in some cases, friends and family. Read about my professional journey and get in touch if you have any questions.
